## Game Design Document

### Core Concept

ETG-like top-down bullet hell in which the player will beat bosses by parring bullets back at them along with the beat.

### Limitations

* Keep the game short. At most three levels, but focus on one for now.
* Add a menu.
* Keep the art scaled back.

### Main Features

* Parrying in time with the music to return bullets will be the main (only?) way to deal damage.
    * Perhaps a Sekiro-like stance where you must parry to knock down the boss to be able to deal damage.
* Tight and tense fights.
    * See Furi for a reference
        * 3 attempts at each stage.
    * No regen?
* Wireframe-like 3D top-down graphics to keep the art simple.

### Known Problems

* It's vital that you need to look at both enemies and yourself.
    * Perhaps this can be accomplished by having small enemies that you can fire at to clear.
* Problem with an oxymoron: How can you parry reactively if you simply parry every beat?
    * Parriable objects must by necessity be rare.
        * Perhaps parryable bullets are rare and unpredictable, and need to be parried within a single beat.
        * Perhaps "on the beat" can by kept by having to attack on the beat after having performed a parry.
    * Parrying needs to be restrained.
        * Failing a parry could leave you unable to roll for a bit.

### Notes and Ideas

* Wipe the screen of bullets when you take damage
* Grid sliding below you to make it seem like you're flying along.
* Succesful parry marks
