## Game Design Document

### Core Concept

ETG-like top-down bullet hell in which the player will beat bosses by parring bullets back at them along with the beat.

### Limitations

* Keep the game short. At most three levels, but focus on one for now.
* Add a menu.
* Keep the art scaled back.

### Main Features

* Parrying in time with the music to return bullets will be the main (only?) way to deal damage.
    * Perhaps a Sekiro-like stance where you must parry to knock down the boss to be able to deal damage.
* Tight and tense fights.
    * No regen?
* Wireframe-like 3D top-down graphics to keep the art simple.
